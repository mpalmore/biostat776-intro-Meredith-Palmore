## About Me

Hello! I am Meredith Palmore, a second year MHS student in Genetic Epidemiology.  


## Background

I graduated from the University of Virginia in 2020. At UVA, I studied Biology and Global Public Health. I conducted research in a laboratory where I used histology to visualize morphological changes in diseased coronary arteries. 

## Research interests

I am particularly interested in the impacts of social and environmental exposures on the epigenome. I am also interested in understanding how epigenomic footprint can be used as a biomarker to capture exposures that are difficult to measure. 

## Data analysis experience

Much of my data analysis experience is from what I have learned in class at UVA and in my first year at Johns Hopkins. However, this last summer I practiced using the command line and data manipulation in R while working on an epigenomics project. 

While taking this course, I would like to get in the habit of using GitHub and continue to practice coding in R.

## Five interesting facts about me

* I graduated from the University of Virginia in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic.
* I played ultimate frisbee at the club level in my undergraduate days.
* I love being outdoors! I mostly accomplish this by going on runs as often as I can.
* I love coffee and am probably going to invest in a portable espresso maker soon (?)
* My parents have a dachshund that I love to play with.
